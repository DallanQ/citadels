[assasin-card-stay-silent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2168610/assasin-card-stay-silent)

> According to the Assassin card; "The player who has the murdered character must say nothing, and must remain silent when the murdered character is called upon to take his turn. The murdered character misses his entire turn, and must remain silent when the murdered character is called upon to take his turn."
> Does that mean if the player with the assasins card announces that he wants to kill the merchant, the Player with the merchant card should remain completely silent and not say anything at all? So people would presume that maybe Merchant card was discarded?

Correct! At that point in the round, it's unknown if the Merchant was a player or a discard at that point. By the end of the round, it will become obvious (since the Player with the merchant card would not have taken a turn).

Call the name of another character whom you wish to kill. When the killed character is called to take his turn, he must remain silent and skip his entire turn for this round without revealing his character card.

[question-regarding-the-architech](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/493329/question-regarding-the-architech)

> The Architect special ability says "After you take an action, draw 2 extra cards and put both in your hand. You may build up to three districts during your turn."
> My question is; What is the meaning of 'After you take an action'? Does that mean: after you get the 2 coins/draw a card? 
 
Action refers to The first step of your turn (get 2 gold OR get 2 district cards and keep one). In Citadels, an "action" always means "take 2 coins, or draw 2 cards and keep 1". 

----
Page 7

During a turn, the player must gather resources. He can either take two gold from the bank or draw two district cards from the deck, choose one to keep, and discard the other facedown to the bottom of the deck.

[what-happens-when-the-witch-takes-the-merchantarch](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/293993/what-happens-when-the-witch-takes-the-merchantarch)

>  In the rules it says that the witch does get the extra gold and the extra cards, but since the merchant and architect get to act out that phase of their turn do they also get the extra gold/extra card, and thus the ability is performed twice- once by the merchant/architect and once by the witch? Or does the witch just "steal" the ability even if the ability takes place in the "take an action" phase of their turn?

**Each ability is used only once: either by the player (if he isn't selected) or the witch if she bewitches that character:** 
At the beginning of their turn, each player may take an action. An action is 1) take 2 gold -OR- 2) Draw 2 District cards keeping only one.
The Witch says to take one of these actions first, then declare your "victim." So at this point you would only take 2 gold or 2 cards, keeping one.
When the Victim comes up, they get an action as well but can't use the special ability of their character. So they only get 2 gold or 2 cards, keeping one. There turn is now over.
The witch then resumes her turn and can use the special ability of the character "(including the gold bonus of the Merchant or the two card bonus of the Architect)" in her own city.

So if the player bewtiched the Arcitect, the Witch may now draw 2 more cards and build up to 3 buildings. If she bewitches the merchant, she would get 1 extra gold piece now plus 1 gold for all her green buildings.

----
Page 7

A player may use his character's abilities only once per turn at the time specified. If no time is specified, the player can use the ability at any time during his turn. Some characters have abilities that gain gold for districts of a certain type in their city. As a reminder, these characters' rank number appears on a gem of the color of its corresponding district type. Character abilities are explained in detail on pages 14–15. These abilities are the heart of the game, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before the game begins.

For two players, each player chooses 2 roles and the player with the king token calls out the roles by number.

NOTE: The players don't take turns playing, instead, the characters are revealed in numerical order, and whoever has the next character takes their turn.

> At what point during a player's turn does he use his special ability? For example, the Magician may exchange hands with someone. Does he do it before or after his action? 

They may use their ability at any point, with a few exceptions though. For example, the Merchant may build a green building then collect his bonus money for green building(s). He cannot, however, collect his bonus money, use it to build a green building, then collect another gold for the new building.

Character abilities are optional (unless the word "must" or "cannot" is used), and each ability can be used only once per turn at the time specified; if no time is specified, the ability can be used at any time during the turn. This includes abilities that gain resources for districts in your city as well. For example, if you are the Bishop, you might choose to gain gold before building a new district (if you need the gold to build that district) or after building (to gain gold from a newly built religious district).

> Can the warlord destroy the poorhouse and gets an extra coin from the person who has build it?

The Warlord can destroy a Building, by paying one less than the cost to build it. In addition he earns one gold for each red building he owns (before or after building in the same turn).
The Poor House gives one coin to the owner, if the owner has no gold at the end of his turn. It costs 5 gold to build.
Since the Poor House has no special defence against the Warlord he can destroy it by paying 4 gold.

The only building the Warlord can't destroy is the Keep, which specifically states the Warlord can't destroy it. (And of course he can't destroy any buildings of the player who is currently the Bishop).

----
Page 15

WARLORD: You gain one gold for each military district in your city. You can destroy one district of your choice by paying one fewer gold than its building cost. So, you can destroy a 1-cost district for free, a 2-cost district for 1 gold, a 3-cost district for 2 gold, and so on. You cannot destroy a district in a completed city, but you can destroy one of your own districts. Destroyed districts are discarded facedown to the bottom of the district deck.

> Imagine I play my 8th district. Since the game only ends after that round, if the Armory card is activated to destroy one of those 8 districts (making it a 7 district city), do I get the end-game bonus points refering to an 8 district city?

You can destroy an eight district using the Armory. But the game will still end at the end of the turn and the points for building the 8th district first will still count.

Yes just like the card says, you can still build even if you have no/short of gold, however the Cardinal does need to have enough cards to give to the player they are taking the gold from.
Also the Rules says: "...If you want to build a district, but do not have enough gold to do so, you can take the remaining gold needed from one player. For each gold you take, you must give that player one card from your hand. Then you must pay to build that district in your city..."

No. That is the point of the 2nd character - to use two different abilities.
The only exceptions are Bishop and Tax Collector.

A Bishop will still protect all of your districts no matter what number your other character is.
And a Tax Collector will still get you 1 gold from anyone else that builds (you have to technically pay yourself 1 gold if you build with your other character later in the turn, but this is a moot point).

But these are not so much "using power again" as it is "power still in effect"

[question-about-tief-and-merchant](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/121419/question-about-tief-and-merchant)

> Can district income be stolen by the thief ?

No, when you steal from someone as the Thief, you only get the gold they have when they begin their turn

> When Merchant does not choose to take golds for an action, is he still entitled the additional 1 gold ?

Yes, as the Merchant you can either take 3 gold or 1 gold and the two district cards.

> In the begining of a round, we must put 1 character card face down. Should this be done randomly or choosen by the Crowned player?

Yes, it should be a randomly chosen card and it does not matter if it's the King or Emperor. If the King or Emperor is not chosen in a round for whatever reason (or is assassinated), the currently crowned player retains the crown.

[what-makes-up-a-district](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/500880/what-makes-up-a-district)

> How is a district formed?

Each one of the building cards is considered a "district." You simply build one card by paying the amount of gold pictured on it, and that's your first district.

Both characters help you toward building a city.

[the-king-card-during-setup](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/645710/the-king-card-during-setup)

> Can somebody tell me the significant role that the King card plays (if necessary at all) during setup?

The king determines the starting player for choosing the characters next round. If you did not include the King, then you WOULD have the static situation that the same person will continue to be king and continue to draw first. By forcing the king to be in the mix, another player can then take it in order to choose his role first next time.

So the King is a key component in the flow of the game.

> Can the magician trade hands with someone that's been stolen from by the thief?

No, because The person who has been robbed by the thief is not identified until their turn, so the magician doesn't know what player will be stolen from. The magician names a player, not a role.

The thief steals as soon as the victim is revealed, so the thief steals *before* the victim actually does anything.

> I thought the first player to build 8 districts ends the game. So how do others able to get the +2 to also reach the same figure?

The game ends with a complete round; ALL players get to take their turn. So if two people are on 7 districts, the advantage lies with the lower numbered characters.
The Rules says: When a player builds his eighth district, the game ends **after the current round is completed**.

> Does the Witch gets the extra coin/2 cards when bewitching the Merchant/Architect.

Yes the Witch does, the rules says so.
Quote:
After you take an action, announce the title of another character that you wish to
bewitch, then immediately end your turn. When the bewitched character is called upon, its player must show his character card, take an action, and then immediately end his turn. You now resume this player’s turn as if you were playing the bewitched character, using all that character’s powers (including the gold bonus of the Merchant or the two card bonus of the Architect) in your city.
