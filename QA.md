[assasin-card-stay-silent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2168610/assasin-card-stay-silent)

> According to the Assassin card; "The player who has the murdered character must say nothing, and must remain silent when the murdered character is called upon to take his turn. The murdered character misses his entire turn, and must remain silent when the murdered character is called upon to take his turn." Does that mean that when Merchant is called upon, Player B should remain completely silent and not say anything at all? So people would presume that maybe Merchant card was discarded?

Correct! At that point in the round, it's unknown if the Merchant was a player or a discard at that point. By the end of the round, it will become obvious (since Player B would not have taken a turn).

[question-regarding-the-architech](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/493329/question-regarding-the-architech)

> The Architect special ability says "After you take an action, draw 2 extra cards and put both in your hand. You may build up to three districts during your turn."
> My question is; What is the meaning of 'After you take an action'? Does that mean: after you get the 2 coins/draw a card? 
 
Action refers to The first step of your turn (get 2 gold OR get 2 district cards and keep one). In Citadels, an "action" always means "take 2 coins, or draw 2 cards and keep 1". 

[what-happens-when-the-witch-takes-the-merchantarch](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/293993/what-happens-when-the-witch-takes-the-merchantarch)

>  In the rules it says that the witch does get the extra gold and the extra cards, but since the merchant and architect get to act out that phase of their turn do they also get the extra gold/extra card, and thus the ability is performed twice- once by the merchant/architect and once by the witch? Or does the witch just "steal" the ability even if the ability takes place in the "take an action" phase of their turn?

**Each ability is used only once: either by the player (if he isn't selected) or the witch if she bewitches that character:** At the beginning of their turn, each player may take an action. When the Victim comes up, they get an action as well but can't use the special ability of their character. So they only get 2 gold or 2 cards, keeping one. Their turn is now over. The witch then resumes her turn and can use the special ability of the character.

> how do i play 1x1? does the player have to reveal all his characters in one step and make 2 moves? 

For two players, each player chooses 2 roles and the player with the king token calls out the roles by number. Each of the 4 chosen roles are then played in number order regardless of which player has which role. NOTE: The players don't take turns playing, instead, the characters are revealed in numerical order, and whoever has the next character takes their turn.

They may use their ability at any point, with a few exceptions though. For example, the Merchant may build a green building then collect his bonus money for green building(s). He cannot, however, collect his bonus money, use it to build a green building, then collect another gold for the new building.

My question is, Does the witch now get to do an action (take 2 gold/cards) again, or does she just get the bonus of the bewitched character? 

No, the Witch does her action on her turn, at which point she stops her turn. Then, when the bewitched character has performed their action, the Witch takes over their turn *at that point* so doesn't get a second action, but can use the bewitched character's special action and then build a district (or more if bewitching the Architect).
