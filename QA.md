[assasin-card-stay-silent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2168610/assasin-card-stay-silent)

> I am confused by the wording "The player who has the murdered
character must say nothing, and must remain silent when the murdered character is called upon to take his turn. The murdered character misses his entire turn." .....
"and must remain silent when the murdered character is called upon
to take his turn." Does that mean that when Merchant is called upon, Player B should remain completely silent and not say anything at all? So people would presume that maybe Merchant card was discarded?

Correct! At that point in the round, it's unknown if the Merchant was a player or a discard at that point. By the end of the round, it will become obvious (since Player B would not have taken a turn).

[question-regarding-the-architech](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/493329/question-regarding-the-architech)

> My question is; What is the meaning of 'After you take an action'? Does that mean:
1) after you get the 2 coins or draw a card? Or
2) after you get the 2 coins or draw a card? Then, after building houses, i.e. you are only allow to draw 2 extra cards as your very last move.

**Action** = The first step of your turn (get 2 gold OR get 2 district cards and keep one)
In Citadels, an "action" always means "take 2 coins, or draw 2 cards and keep 1". Then the rest of your turn consists of building, and using your character's special power.

[what-happens-when-the-witch-takes-the-merchantarch](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/293993/what-happens-when-the-witch-takes-the-merchantarch)

>  In the rules it says that the witch does get the extra gold and the extra cards, but since the merchant and architect get to act out that phase of their turn do they also get the extra gold/extra card, and thus the ability is performed twice- once by the merchant/architect and once by the witch? Or does the witch just "steal" the ability even if the ability takes place in the "take an action" phase of their turn?

**Each ability is used only once - either by the player (if he isn't selected) or the witch if she bewitches that character:** At the beginning of their turn, each player may take an action. An action is 1) take 2 gold -OR- 2) Draw 2 District cards keeping only one. When the Victim comes up, they get an action as well but can't use the special ability of their character. So they only get 2 gold or 2 cards, keeping one. Their turn is now over.


[2players-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/812294/2players-question)

> I dont understand something in rulebook in game with 2 players
The first player put one card randomly close on the table then he choose one card and give the cards to the second player...
The second player choose one card for him and then he choose one card and he put it on the table!!! This second card choosing randomly without knowing from the second player or he can put on the table Any card he wants?

Yes, Player 2 chooses both his own character card and the one to place face-down in the middle of the table.

[beginner-needs-help-with-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2983049/beginner-needs-help-with-rules)

> 1. does Bishop protect all buildings from demolition or only church buildings?
2. how do i play 1x1? does the player have to reveal all his characters in one step and make 2 moves? the rules for two characters say so, but i don't understand it.

1. The Bishop protects all of your buildings from destruction. The rulebook says: "Your districts may not be destroyed/exchanged by the Warlord/Diplomat." In the game, "district" means any building card.
2. For two players, each player chooses 2 roles and the player with the king token calls out the roles by number. Each of the 4 chosen roles are then played in number order regardless of which player has which role. NOTE: The players don't take turns playing, instead, the characters are revealed in numerical order, and whoever has the next character takes their turn.

The rulebook says: "Your districts may not be destroyed/exchanged by the Warlord/Diplomat." In the game "district" means any building card, so the Bishop protects all of your buildings from destruction.
[when-does-a-player-use-his-special-ability](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/68239/when-does-a-player-use-his-special-ability)

> At what point during a player's turn does he use his special ability? For example, the Magician may exchange hands with someone. Does he do it before or after his action? This may effect if he takes gold or a card. Can he even wait until after he builds a district? We've been playing that the player can use his special ability at any point in his turn as the rules do not specify that it must be used at any specific time.

You are correct. They may use their ability at any point, with a few exceptions though. For example, the Merchant may build a green building THEN collect his bonus money for green building(s). He cannot, however, collect his bonus money, use it to build a green building, then collect ANOTHER gold for the new building.

> Are gold coins limited in the game? When there's no more that's it? If not, what do you use to supplement coins?

The amount of gold is not limited by components, you can use a suitable replacement (real coins, matchsticks, apples, or oranges) if you run out.

[witch](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1276403/witch)

> When the bewitched character is called upon, they take an action then end their turn. Then the witch takes over the rest of the turn. My question is, Does the witch now get to do an action (take 2 gold/cards) again, or does she just get the bonus of the bewitched character? Thanks.

No, the Witch does her action on her turn, at which point she stops her turn. Then, when the bewitched character has performed their action, the Witch takes over their turn *at that point* so doesn't get a second action, but can use the bewitched character's special action and then build a district (or more if bewitching the Architect).

[players-in-clockwise-order](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/871034/players-in-clockwise-order)
> Instead of going by character number sequence and having the king announcing that order sequence, have the person with the king role (if not, randomly select the first player) starts the turn and everyone take each round clockwise. Perhaps this variant might be more suitable for those who take greater interest in building districts than for those who find pleasure screwing each other? I get the impression that the game might somewhat be unbalanced in the sense that advantage tends to go to those who take their turns the later the more, since you already know who is who and whom to target--and becomes more of a personal level thing than a character level thing? Can someone affirm or deny this?

The Assassin and Thief go first and second, so they are taking guesses as to what other roles were picked. Those are the real "screw you" roles and there is no guarantee you will hit with them. (If I say "Bishop" and nobody has chosen the Bishop, my power goes wasted.)

No. That is the point of the 2nd character - to use two different abilities.

[assasinated-bishop](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/69092/assasinated-bishop)

> If the Bishop is assasinated, can the Warlord (or Diplomat) destroy (or swap) one of his buildings? Presumably, the Bishop has not yet revealed who he/she is, though it would be obvious unless someone else has the Artist or the Queen. If the answer is yes, a dead Bishop can be targeted, then this allows the Assasin and the Warlord/Diplomat to gang up on a Bishop that is in the lead. If the answer is no, then what happens when the Warlord/Diplomat tries? Does he keep his gold or is it lost in a blundered attempt?

The official FAQ (http://www.bggfiles.com/viewfile.php3?fileid=10218) says that a dead Bishop is not protected from the Warlord/Diplomat. Whether you didn't reveal your role because you chose to skip your turn or because you were assassinated, you just don't reveal it period. This also means that you don't get to use its special powers. So, in our games, the assassinated Bishop would not get to collect on blue buildings or be protected from the Warlord.
