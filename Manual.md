introduction In Citadels, players are vying to become the kingdom's next Master Builder, but first they must impress the monarchy with their city-building skills.

During a round, each player chooses one character, who provides a special ability for that turn. Each player builds his own city by playing district cards from his hand, which at the end of the game are worth points equal to their cost.

The game ends at the end of the round in which a player has seven districts in his city, and the player with the most points will become the kingdom's next Master Builder!

## A Brief History Of Citadels

Citadels was first released in the year 2000 and is widely revered as a modern gaming masterpiece. Its success led to an expansion a few years later, and over the last decade and a half the game has been published in 25 languages and packaged in boxes of all shapes and sizes.

This classic edition of the game is essentially Citadels as it was first published back in 2000—the original cast of eight characters, a crown card, cardboard gold tokens, and a few minor updates to rules and cards.

setup To set up the game, follow these steps:

1. Shuffle the district cards and deal four cards facedown to each player. These cards are the players' starting hands.

2. Place the remaining district cards in a facedown pile in the center of the table to create the district deck; then create the bank by placing all gold coins in the center of the table.

3. Each player takes two gold from the bank. This gold belongs to the player and stays in his personal stash until he uses it.

4. The oldest player takes the crown.

playing the GAme The rules are explained for games with 4–7 players. Rule changes for 2- and 3-player games can be found on pages 12–13.

Citadels is played over a series of rounds. Each round begins with the selection phase, during which players pass around the character cards and choose one character for the round. Each character card has special abilities, such as stealing another player's gold or destroying another player's district. After the selection phase comes the turn phase, during which players gather resources and build new districts in their city.

The player who has the crown is known as the crowned player, who makes sure that each step is followed in order and calls for each character to take his turn during the turn phase.

Selection Phase The crowned player gathers the deck of eight character cards and shuffles it. First he randomly discards a number of them faceup in the center of the table, and then he randomly discards one facedown. The number of discarded faceup cards depends on the number of players in the game (see the table below). Discarded cards are not used this round.

Next, the crowned player takes the remaining character cards, looks at them, and secretly chooses one to keep. Then he passes the remaining cards to the player on his left, who also chooses a card and passes the rest of the cards to his left, and so on. This continues until each player has chosen one character card. After the last player has chosen his card, he discards the one unchosen card facedown near the other discarded cards.

- Special Rule with 7 Players: After the sixth player passes the last character card to the seventh player, the seventh player also takes the character card that was discarded facedown at the beginning of the round. He chooses one of these two cards and discards the other facedown.

open informationthe amount of gold and cards each player has is open information. There is an unlimited amount of gold. If the bank runs out, players can use a substitute for gold. Also, there is no limit to a player's handsize.

Important: The King cannot be among the faceup discarded cards. If the King is discarded faceup, discard another character card faceup to replace the King and shuffle the King into the

Turn Phase Unlike the selection phase, players do not take turns in clockwise order during the turn phase. Instead, they take turns in ascending order of their chosen character's rank, which appears in the top-left corner of each character card. The crowned player calls each character number in ascending order, starting with the number "1" (the Assassin). If a player has the called character card, he reveals it by flipping it faceup and takes his turn.

A player has a building limit of one district per turn, and a player cannot build a district that is identical (with the same name) to a district already in his city.

After the player with the called character has taken his turn, or if no player revealed the called character, the crowned player continues calling the next character in ascending order, and so on until he has called all characters, after which a new round begins with the selection phase.

Character Abilities A player may use his character's abilities only once per turn at the time specified. If no time is specified, the player can use the ability at any time during his turn. Some characters have abilities that gain gold for districts of a certain type in their city. As a reminder, these characters' rank number appears on a gem of the color of its corresponding district type. Character abilities are explained in detail on pages 14–15. These abilities are the heart of the game, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before the game begins.

Assassin's RAnk

During a turn, the player must gather resources. He can either take two gold from the bank or draw two district cards from the deck, choose one to keep, and discard the other facedown to the bottom of the deck.

After gathering resources, he may build one district in his city. To do this, he plays a card from his hand faceup in front of him and pays gold to the bank equal to the district's building cost.

The Warlord was the last character in the round, so this round is over. The crowned player gathers all character cards to shuffle them and prepare for the next selection phase.

Districts There are five district types, which are indicated by the different colored gems. District types are referenced by some character abilities.

Game End As soon as a city has seven districts, it has been completed; the game will end after the current round is finished. A city can have more than seven districts.

Each unique district has an effect, which is described on its card. These effects can do a variety of things, such as gain you more resources of a certain type or provide extra points at the end of the game. District effects are optional unless the word "must" or "cannot" is used.

When the game ends, players score points as follows:

- Score points equal to the building cost of each of your districts.

- If your city has at least one district of each type, score 3 points.

- The player who first completed his city scores 4 points.

- Any other player who completed his city scores 2 points.

- Score any extra points from your unique districts.

Rules text on caRdsrules text that appears on cards is a brief summary of the card's effect. For the complete rules of a character's ability, see "Character Abilities in Detail" on pages 14–15. If text on a card seems to conflict with text on pages 14–15, the text in the rulebook takes precedence.

Players compare point totals, and the player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the tied player who revealed the character with the highest- numbered rank in the last round wins.

playing with 2 or 3 players In 2- or 3-player games, each player plays with two characters. The game is played normally, except that each player takes two turns each round (one turn for each character). Each player has only one stash of gold and one city, and each character's ability applies only during its own turn.

For example, a player with both the Architect and the Warlord can save a district drawn during his Architect turn to build later that round during his Warlord turn. Also, the Architect's ability to build more than one district does not apply during his Warlord turn.

2-Player Selection Phase The crowned player gathers the deck of character cards and shuffles it. He randomly discards one card facedown in the center of the table. Then he takes the remaining seven cards, secretly chooses one to keep for himself, and passes the remaining six cards to his opponent.

For the remaining selections this round, each player chooses two character cards: one he keeps, the other he discards facedown near the other discarded cards, and then he passes the remaining cards to his opponent. This continues until there are no more characters remaining.

Also, a completed city requires at least eight districts; the game will end after the current round is finished.

The rules for the selection phase slightly differ between the 2- and 3-player games, as explained here:

3-Player Selection Phase The crowned player gathers the deck of character cards and shuffles it. He randomly discards one card facedown in the center of the table. Then he takes the remaining seven cards, secretly chooses one to keep for himself, and passes the remaining six cards to the player on his left, who also chooses a card and passes the rest of the cards to his left, and so on. This continues until each player has chosen two character cards. After the last player has chosen his second card, the one unchosen card is discarded facedown near the other discarded card.

classic VARiant If players wish to play Citadels with 4–7 players in its original form, they may choose to use the classic variant. In this variant, a city is not considered completed until it has eight districts in it (instead of seven).

chARActer Abilities in detail This section explains each character's abilities in full detail. Remember, character abilities are optional (unless the word "must" or "cannot" is used), and each ability can be used only once per turn at the time specified; if no time is specified, the ability can be used at any time during the turn. This includes abilities that gain resources for districts in your city as well. For example, if you are the Bishop, you might choose to gain gold before building a new district (if you need the gold to build that district) or after building (to gain gold from a newly built religious district).

1) Assassin

Call the name of another character whom you wish to kill. When the killed character is called to take his turn, he must remain silent and skip his entire turn for this round without revealing his character card.

2) thief

Call the name of another character whom you wish to rob. When a player reveals that character to take his turn, you immediately take all of his gold. You cannot rob the Assassin or the killed character.

3) maGician

You can do one of following:

## The

- Exchange your entire hand of cards with another player's hand of cards; if you have zero cards in your hand, you simply take the other player's cards.

- Discard any number of cards from your hand facedown to the bottom of the district deck to gain an equal number of cards from the district deck.

4) king

You gain one gold for each noble district in your city. At some point during your turn, you must take the crown. You are now the crowned player, so you call characters for the rest of the round, and you will be the first to choose a character during the next round (until another player chooses the King). If you are killed, you skip your turn like any other character. At the end of the round, reveal the King's character card and take the crown as the King's heir.

5) bishop

You gain one gold for each religious district in your city.

During this round, the Warlord cannot destroy your districts. If you are killed, your districts can be destroyed by the Warlord.

## ) Merchant

You gain one gold for each trade district in your city. You gain one extra gold. You can use this ability regardless of what resource you gathered this turn.

7) ARchitect

Gain two extra cards. You can use this ability regardless of what resource you gathered this turn. You can build up to three districts.

8) waRlord

You gain one gold for each military district in your city. You can destroy one district of your choice by paying one fewer gold than its building cost. So, you can destroy a 1-cost district for free, a 2-cost district for 1 gold, a 3-cost district for 2 gold, and so on. You cannot destroy a district in a completed city, but you can destroy one of your own districts. Destroyed districts are discarded facedown to the bottom of the district deck.
