## SETUP (Page 4)

To set up the game, follow these steps:

1. Shuffle the district cards and deal four cards facedown to each player. These cards are the players' starting hands.

2. Place the remaining district cards in a facedown pile in the center of the table to create the district deck; then create the bank by placing all gold coins in the center of the table.

3. Each player takes two gold from the bank. This gold belongs to the player and stays in his personal stash until he uses it.

4. The oldest player takes the crown.

### SETUP DIAGRAM (4-PLAYER GAME) (Page 5)

> Image of 4 District cards facedown and 2 gold coin each for 3 players, a bank of gold coins, and District cards deck. The crowned player's play area(4th player) consists of Character cards deck, 2 starting gold coins, four starting District cards, and a crown card.

## PLAYING THE GAME (Page 4)
The rules are explained for games with 4–7 players. Rule changes for 2- and 3-player games can be found on pages 12–13.

**Citadels** is played over a series of rounds. Each round begins with the selection phase, during which players pass around the character cards and choose one character for the round. Each character card has special abilities, such as stealing another player's gold or destroying another player's district. After the selection phase comes the turn phase, during which players gather resources and build new districts in their city.

The player who has the crown is known as the **CROWNED PLAYER**, who makes sure that each step is followed in order and calls for each character to take his turn during the turn phase.

### SELECTION PHASE (Page 6)
The crowned player gathers the deck of eight character cards and shuffles it. First he randomly discards a number of them **faceup** in the center of the table, and then he randomly discards one **facedown**. The number of discarded faceup cards depends on the number of players in the game (see the table below). Discarded cards are not used this round.


|PLAYERS|  FACEUP CARDS|  FACEDOWN CARDS|
|-------|--------------|----------------|
|4      |2             |1               |
|5|1|1|
|6|0|1|
|7|0|1|

**Important:** 
The King cannot be among the faceup discarded cards. If the King is discarded faceup, discard another character card faceup to replace the King and shuffle the King into the character deck.

Next, the crowned player takes the remaining character cards, looks at them, and secretly chooses one to keep. Then he passes the remaining cards to the player on his left, who also chooses a card and passes the rest of the cards to his left, and so on. This continues until each player has chosen one character card. After the last player has chosen his card, he discards the one unchosen card facedown near the other discarded cards.

#### Special Rule with 7 Players (page 6)
After the sixth player passes the last character card to the seventh player, the seventh player also takes the character card that was discarded facedown at the beginning of the round. He chooses one of these two cards and discards the other facedown.

#### OPEN INFORMATION (page 6)
The amount of gold and cards each player has is open information. There is an unlimited amount of gold. If the bank runs out, players can use a substitute for gold. Also, there is no limit to a player's handsize.

### Turn Phase (Page 7)
Unlike the selection phase, players do not take turns in clockwise order during the turn phase. Instead, they take turns in ascending order of their chosen character's rank, which appears in the top-left corner of each character card. The crowned player calls each character number in ascending order, starting with the number "1" (the Assassin). If a player has the called character card, he reveals it by flipping it faceup and takes his turn.

> image of an assassin card with a badge showing the number 1

During a turn, the player **must** gather resources. He can either take two gold from the bank or draw two district cards from the deck, choose one to keep, and discard the other facedown to the bottom of the deck.

After gathering resources, he **may** build one district in his city. To do this, he plays a card from his hand faceup in front of him and pays gold to the bank equal to the district’s building cost. 

> image of a dock card showing 3 gold coins, which is the docks' cost

A player has a building limit of one district per turn, and a player cannot build a district that is identical (with the same name) to a district already in his city.

After the player with the called character has taken his turn, or if no player revealed the called character, the crowned player continues calling the next character in ascending order, and so on until he has called all characters, after which a new round begins with the selection phase.

#### EXAMPLE OF A TURN (Page 8)

Kurt just finished his turn as the Architect. The next character called is the Warlord. Ashley chose the Warlord during the selection phase, so she flips her character card faceup and takes her turn.
1. Earlier in the round, Anna was the Thief and chose to rob the Warlord. Now that the Warlord is revealed, Anna takes all the gold in Ashley's stash.

2. Next, Ashley gathers resources. To try and recuperate a portion of her stolen coins, she chooses to gain two gold from the bank.

3. Kurt appears to be in the lead, so Ashley decides to pay one gold to destroy his Market, which he discards facedown to the bottom of the deck.

> Image of a Warlord card with an arrow showing 1 coin moving from the warlord card to the bank, and another arrow showing a District card being moved facedown to the bottom of the District cards deck.

4. Now she chooses to gain gold for her military districts. She has a Prison and the School of Magic, which she can count here as a military district, so she gains two more gold from the bank. She now has three gold in her stash.

> Image of a Warlord card and 3 gold cions with an arrow showing 2 gold coins moving from the Bank to the Warlord card. And, an image of a Prison and the School of Magic card.

5. She pays three gold to build a Barracks, placing it in her city next to her other districts. She has already used her character ability to gain gold, so she does not gain gold this turn for her Barracks. Since she has used her abilities and built her one district for the turn, her turn ends.

The Warlord was the last character in the round, so this round is over. The crowned player gathers all character cards to shuffle them and prepare for the next selection phase.

#### Character Abilities (Page 7)
A player **may** use his character's abilities only once per turn at the time specified. If no time is specified, the player can use the ability at any time during his turn. Some characters have abilities that gain gold for districts of a certain type in their city. As a reminder, these characters' rank number appears on a gem of the color of its corresponding district type. Character abilities are explained in detail on pages 14–15. These abilities are the heart of the game, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before the game begins.


## Districts (Page 10)
There are five district types, which are indicated by the different colored gems. District types are referenced by some character abilities.

Game End As soon as a city has seven districts, it has been completed; the game will end after the current round is finished. A city can have more than seven districts.

Each **unique** district has an effect, which is described on its card. These effects can do a variety of things, such as gain you more resources of a certain type or provide extra points at the end of the game. District effects are optional unless the word "must" or "cannot" is used.

## RULES TEXT ON CARDS (Page 10)
Rules text that appears on cards is a brief summary of the card's effect. For the complete rules of a character's ability, see "Character Abilities in Detail" on pages 14–15. If text on a card seems to conflict with text on pages 14–15, the text in the rulebook takes precedence.

## Game End (Page 10)
As soon as a city has seven districts, it has been completed; the game will end after the current round is finished. A city can have more than seven districts.
When the game ends, players score points as follows:

- Score points equal to the building cost of each of your districts.

- If your city has at least one district of each type, score 3 points.

- The player who first completed his city scores 4 points.

- Any other player who completed his city scores 2 points.

- Score any extra points from your UNIQUE districts.

Players compare point totals, and the player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the tied player who revealed the character with the **highest- numbered rank** in the last round wins.

### Endgame Scoring Example (Page 11)

> Image of KURT'S City: 7 District cards and their points denoting a complete city "A Castle card with 4 points, a Tavern card with 1 point, a Trading post with 2 points, a Monastry card with 3 points, a Cathedral card with 5 points, a Observatory card with 4 points, a Haunted Quater card with 2 points"

KURT'S City totaling of 21 points, for being the first to complete a city he gains 4 points, and 3 points because he has 1 district of each type (Haunted Quarter counts as militart district) 
KURT'S points totaling = 28 points.

> Image of ASHLEY'S City: 7 District cards and their points denoting a complete city "A Docks card with 3 points, a Trading post card with 2 points, a Barracks card with 3 points, a Prison card with 2 points, a Manor card with 3 points, a School of Magic with 6 points, a Dragon gate card with 6 points"

ASKLEY'S City totaling 25 points, for completing a city but not being first she gains 2 points, and 2 points because she has extra points from Dragon Gate card.
ASHLEY'S points totaling = 29 points - ASHLEY WINS!

## PLAYING WITH 2 OR 3 PLAYERS (Page 12)
In 2- or 3-player games, each player plays with **two characters**. The game is played normally, except that each player takes two turns each round (one turn for each character). Each player has only one stash of gold and one city, and each character's ability applies only during its own turn.

For example, a player with both the Architect and the Warlord can save a district drawn during his Architect turn to build later that round during his Warlord turn. Also, the Architect's ability to build more than one district does not apply during his Warlord turn.
Also, a completed city requires at least eight districts; the game will end after the current round is finished.

The rules for the selection phase slightly differ between the 2- and 3-player games, as explained here:

### 2-Player Selection Phase (Page 12)
The crowned player gathers the deck of character cards and shuffles it. He randomly discards one card facedown in the center of the table. Then he takes the remaining seven cards, secretly chooses one to keep for himself, and passes the remaining six cards to his opponent.

For the remaining selections this round, each player chooses two character cards: one he keeps, the other he discards facedown near the other discarded cards, and then he passes the remaining cards to his opponent. This continues until there are no more characters remaining.



### 3-Player Selection Phase (Page 13)
The crowned player gathers the deck of character cards and shuffles it. He randomly discards one card facedown in the center of the table. Then he takes the remaining seven cards, secretly chooses one to keep for himself, and passes the remaining six cards to the player on his left, who also chooses a card and passes the rest of the cards to his left, and so on. This continues until each player has chosen two character cards. After the last player has chosen his second card, the one unchosen card is discarded facedown near the other discarded card.

## CLASSIC VARIANT (page 13)
If players wish to play Citadels with 4–7 players in its original form, they may choose to use the classic variant. In this variant, a city is not considered completed until it has eight districts in it (instead of seven).

## CHARACTER ABILITIES IN DETAIL (Page 14)
This section explains each character's abilities in full detail. Remember, character abilities are optional (unless the word "must" or "cannot" is used), and each ability can be used only once per turn at the time specified; if no time is specified, the ability can be used at **any time** during the turn. This includes abilities that gain resources for districts in your city as well. For example, if you are the Bishop, you might choose to gain gold before building a new district (if you need the gold to build that district) or after building (to gain gold from a newly built religious district).

### ASSASSIN (page 14)
Call the name of another character whom you wish to kill. When the killed character is called to take his turn, he must remain silent and skip his entire turn for this round without revealing his character card.

### THIEF (page 14)
Call the name of another character whom you wish to rob. When a player reveals that character to take his turn, you immediately take all of his gold. You cannot rob the Assassin or the killed character.

### MAGICIAN (page 14)
You can do one of following:
- Exchange your entire hand of cards with another player's hand of cards; if you have zero cards in your hand, you simply take the other player's cards.

- Discard any number of cards from your hand facedown to the bottom of the district deck to gain an equal number of cards from the district deck.

### KING (page 15)
You gain one gold for each **NOBLE** district in your city. At some point during your turn, you must take the crown. You are now the crowned player, so you call characters for the rest of the round, and you will be the first to choose a character during the next round (until another player chooses the King). If you are killed, you skip your turn like any other character. At the end of the round, reveal the King's character card and take the crown as the King's heir.

### BISHOP (page 15)

You gain one gold for each religious district in your city.

During this round, the Warlord cannot destroy your districts. If you are killed, your districts can be destroyed by the Warlord.

### MERCHANT (page 15)
You gain one gold for each trade district in your city. You gain one extra gold. You can use this ability regardless of what resource you gathered this turn.

### ARCHITECT (page 15)

Gain two extra cards. You can use this ability regardless of what resource you gathered this turn. You can build up to three districts.

### WARLORD (page 15)
You gain one gold for each military district in your city. You can destroy one district of your choice by paying one fewer gold than its building cost. So, you can destroy a 1-cost district for free, a 2-cost district for 1 gold, a 3-cost district for 2 gold, and so on. You cannot destroy a district in a completed city, but you can destroy one of your own districts. Destroyed districts are discarded facedown to the bottom of the district deck.

7 | 0 |1* |

- After the 6th player passes the last character card to the 7th player, that player also takes the character card that was discarded facedown at the beginning of this round. He chooses 1 of these two characters and discards the other 1 facedown.
